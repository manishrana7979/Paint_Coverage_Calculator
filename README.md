## 🧾 Project Overview

This project helps calculate:
- ✅ **Total coverage area** (based on liters and coverage per coat)
- ✅ **Cost estimation** (based on price per liter)
- ✅ **Coverage range** (minimum to maximum sqft/L)
- ✅ **Paint requirement for multiple coats**

It was originally inspired by a real-life use case where my sister, a **Paint Consultant at Birla Opus**, needed a faster way to prepare her daily paint coverage reports. With this calculator, what used to take 20–30 minutes can now be done in just **2 minutes**.

## 💡 Example Calculation

If you have:
- 10 liters of paint  
- ₹500 per liter  
- Coverage: 80–100 sqft/L  
- 2 coats  

Then total coverage will be between:
> **800 sqft to 1000 sqft (for 1 coat)**  
> **1600 sqft to 2000 sqft (for 2 coats)**  

and total cost = ₹500 × 10 = ₹5000.
